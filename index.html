    <h2>About the Legend</h2>
    
        <ul>
        <li> A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
            was born on October 15, 1931, in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.</li>
            <li>He served as the 11th President
                of India from 2002 to 2007.</li>
       <li> Kalam earned a degree in
        aeronautical engineering from the
        Madras Institute of Technology and in
        1958 joined the Defence Research and
        Development Organisation (DRDO).</li>
       <li>In 1969, he moved to the Indian
        Space Research Organisation, where he
        was project director of the SLV-III, the
        first satellite launch vehicle that was
        both designed and produced in India.</li>
       <li>Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
        Kalam planned the program that produced
        a number of successful missiles, which
        helped earn him the nickname 
        “Missile Man.”</li>
        <li>Among those successes
            was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
            ballistic missile, which incorporated
            aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
            in 1989.</li>
      <li> He also played a
        pivotal organisational, technical,
        and political role in India's Pokhran-II
        nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
        the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</li>
       <li>From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
        was scientific adviser to the defense
        minister, and he later served as principal
        scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
        government with the rank of cabinet minister.</li>
        <li> His prominent role in
            the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
            solidified India as a nuclear power and
            established Kalam as a national hero,
            although the tests caused great concern
            in the international community.</li> 
       <li>In 1998 Kalam put
        forward a countrywide plan called
        Technology Vision 2020, which he described
        as a road map for transforming India from
        a less-developed to a developed society
        in 20 years. The plan called for, among
        other measures, increasing agricultural
        productivity, emphasizing technology as
        a vehicle for economic growth, and
        widening access to health care and
        education.</li>
        <li> Kalam received <b>7</b>
            honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>
            universities. The Government of India
            honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
            in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
            in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
            DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
            to the Government.</li>
        <li>In 1997, Kalam received
            India's highest civilian honour, the
            Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
            the scientific research and modernisation
            of defence technology in India.</li>
        <li> In 2013, he was the
            recipient of the Von Braun Award from
            the National Space Society "to recognize
            excellence in the management and leadership
            of a space-related project".</li> 
        <li>While delivering a
            lecture at the Indian Institute of
            Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
            died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
            <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.</li>
        <li> Wheeler Island, a
            national missile test site in Odisha, was
            renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
            2015.</li>
        <li> A prominent road in
            New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb
            Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
            in August 2015.</li>
        <li>In February 2018,
            scientists from the Botanical Survey
            of India named a newly found plant
            species as Drypetes kalamii, in his
            honour.</li>
